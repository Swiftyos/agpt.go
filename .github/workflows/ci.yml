# Optimized CI Workflow - Target: <30 seconds
# Based on expert recommendations from Dave Farley & Martin Fowler's Continuous Delivery principles:
# - Fast feedback loops (target: 15-25 seconds)
# - Parallel execution to minimize wait time
# - Unit tests only (no external dependencies)
# - Race detection and E2E tests moved to nightly workflow
